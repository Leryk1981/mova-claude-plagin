# Code Style

- Prefer clear, explicit naming over brevity
- Keep functions small; refactor if they grow complex
- Avoid global side effects; pass dependencies explicitly
- Use stable formatting (no manual alignment)
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for JS/TS)
- Prefer const over let when possible
- Use meaningful variable names
